## Race-a-Pet Project Proposal 
Race-a-Pet is a web-based game where users can create pets and race them against each other. The pet's performance is based on feathers like diet and exercise. We organized this project in stages so we could focus on the main functionality of the website to aid in time management and expectations.

Stage 1 
- Implementing React
- Express
- MongoDB
- Log-ins 
- Keeping track of users and their pets 
- Create a formula based on each petâ€™s features

Stage 2
- Create a Ranking System
- Create functionality so different users can race each other's pets
- Create power-ups

Stage 3
- Conduct a User Study on Features and Styling 
- Make changes based on the outcome of the user study
