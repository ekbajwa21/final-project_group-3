# Race-a-Pet
### by Esha Bajwa, Joselin Barbosa, Jolene Pern 

Race-a-Pet is a web-based game where users can create pets and race them against each other. Users will “design” a pet with various features such as animal type, diet, and exercise. Based on the attributes, a race time is calculated and displayed to the user, along with a leaderboard of all the previous race times ranked by time. Users can manage the leaderboard by adding more pets or delete them from the database. 

## Instructions - Run Locally
- To run, ensure npm and nodemon are installed in the terminal. 
- Open one terminal and type "npm start" and open another terminal and type "nodemon server.js". On Windows, the second terminal may need to be a command prompt. 
- Login using "user" as username and "pass" as password.
